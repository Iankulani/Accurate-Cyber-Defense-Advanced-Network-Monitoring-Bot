# Accurate-Cyber-Defense-Advanced-Network-Monitoring-Bot

Accurate-Cyber-Defense-Advanced-Network-Monitoring-Bot is a cutting-edge, performance-oriented cybersecurity tool designed for real-time network surveillance, traffic analysis, anomaly detection, and threat alerting.

Developed in Rust, a systems programming language known for its safety and speed, this bot offers unmatched reliability and security for enterprise, cloud, and personal network environments.

Unlike traditional monitoring tools that focus only on data collection or visualization, this bot dives deep into real-time packet inspection, flow analysis, and behavioral anomaly detection. 
It is purpose-built to identify suspicious activities, possible breaches, and misconfigurations while maintaining optimal performance even in high-throughput network environments.

Additionally, the bot is equipped with Telegram-based configuration and notification capabilities, allowing users to manage and monitor their network remotely, receive instant alerts, and execute specific defensive actions directly from their mobile devices.

**Key Features**
**1. Rust-Based Core Engine**
 
Memory-Safe by Design: Written in Rust, the bot benefits from Rust’s strong guarantees on memory safety, making it immune to common bugs like buffer overflows and null pointer dereferencing.

High-Speed Packet Processing: Leveraging Rust’s zero-cost abstractions and async runtimes (e.g., Tokio), the bot can process thousands of packets per second with minimal CPU overhead.

Modular & Extensible: The codebase is structured into modular crates, making it easy to extend with custom detection logic, output formats, or new protocols.

**2. Advanced Network Monitoring**

Real-Time Packet Sniffing: Captures and inspects packets from multiple interfaces using efficient asynchronous sniffers.

Protocol Decoding: Supports deep parsing of common protocols (TCP, UDP, DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, ICMP, ARP) and can be extended to parse custom protocols.

Flow-Based Analysis: Reconstructs network sessions and identifies unusual flows (e.g., port scanning, data exfiltration attempts).

Bandwidth Tracking: Monitors per-device and per-protocol bandwidth usage, detecting congestion, DoS patterns, or misuse.

DNS Monitoring: Monitors DNS traffic for suspicious domains, tunneling, or fast-flux behavior.

ARP Poisoning Detection: Flags anomalies in MAC/IP mappings to detect MITM attempts.

**3. Anomaly & Threat Detection**

Heuristic-Based Detection: Includes built-in rules for identifying brute-force attempts, SYN floods, DDoS patterns, and DNS amplification attacks.

Signature Matching: Integrates with popular rule engines (e.g., Snort, Suricata-compatible rulesets) to detect known threats.

Behavioral Profiling: Learns normal traffic patterns and raises alerts for deviations, such as unusual port access or abnormal data volume.

**4. Telegram Configuration and Control**

Remote Management: Configure and control the bot via Telegram using simple commands.

Bot Token & Chat ID Setup: Securely configured using .env file or encrypted config files for Telegram integration.

Command Support Examples:

/status – Returns current system stats, active threats, and network load.

/enable_dns_monitoring – Enables DNS analysis.

/block_ip 192.168.0.101 – Sends command to firewall integration to block a hostile IP.

/set_threshold 500kbps – Adjusts alert thresholds dynamically.

Instant Alerts: Sends real-time notifications of suspicious activities, including metadata like:

Attacker IP, Port

Protocol used

Threat type (e.g., DoS, MITM, port scan)

Packet payload (if safe to include)

5. Customizable Rules and Configuration
Config File Driven: YAML or TOML configuration files define network interfaces, Telegram credentials, thresholds, and rule sets.

User-Defined Filters: Users can define packet filters using BPF syntax or custom Rust closures.

Rule Reloading: Supports hot-reloading of configuration without restarting the service.

6. Cross-Platform and Lightweight
 
Cross-Compatible: Works on Linux, Windows (via WSL or native with WinPcap/Npcap), and macOS.

Low Resource Usage: Optimized for minimal CPU and memory footprint—can run efficiently on Raspberry Pi or embedded systems.

Technical Components

**A. Core Modules**

sniffer: Handles raw packet capture using libraries like libpnet, pcap, or afpacket.

parser: Parses Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP, DNS, and ARP headers.

analyzer: Analyzes packets and reconstructs flows for anomaly detection.

detector: Applies heuristic and rule-based analysis.

notifier: Handles sending messages to Telegram via the Bot API.

config: Reads and validates configurations.

firewall: (Optional) Interface to system firewalls (iptables, ufw, Windows Firewall) for active defense.

**B. Telegram Integration in Rust**

Telegram support is powered by crates like:

teloxide: A high-level framework for building Telegram bots in Rust.

serde: For configuration and message serialization.

dotenv: Secure loading of secrets from environment files.

Example: Basic Telegram Alert Function (Rust)

rust
Copy
Edit
use teloxide::prelude::*;
use teloxide::types::ParseMode;

pub async fn send_alert(bot: Bot, chat_id: ChatId, msg: String) {
    let _ = bot.send_message(chat_id, msg)
        .parse_mode(ParseMode::MarkdownV2)
        .await;
}
